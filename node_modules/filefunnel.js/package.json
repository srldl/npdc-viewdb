  "readme": "# filefunnel.js\nFile Upload JavaScript Widget\n\n## Usage:\nFileFunnel is added to HTML elements by creating a new instance of **FileFunnel** using a CSS selector string as the first parameter, and optionally a map of settings as the secondd parameter. If the target element is a *HTMLInputElement*, FileFunnel will be added as a widget (only visible on demand), otherwise FileFunnel will act as a permanent application added to the target element:\n\n```javascript\n// Append FileFunnel with specified settings to the first div element found\nnew FileFunnel(\"div\", {\n  accept: \"image/png, image/jpeg\",    // Accept PNG and JPEG images only\n  chunked: true,                      // Enable chunked uploading\n  locale: \"en_US\",                    // Use american english as locale\n  multiple: true,                     // Enable upload of multiple files\n  server: \"https://localhost:3751\"    // Server backend accepting files\n});\n\n// Add FileFunnel as a widget to the first input element with a 'filefunnel' attribute\nnew FileFunnel(\"input[filefunnel]\", {\n  autoResize: true,                   // Enable automatic resizing of the widget\n  chunked: true,                      // Enable chunked uploading\n  server: \"https://localhost:3751\"    // Server backed accepting files\n});\n```\n\n#### Constructor options:\nKey               | Value                                                         |

default, only the **en_GB** locale is included, but all available translations can be enabled by including the [filefunnel-i18n.min.js](https://github.com/npolar/filefunnel.js/tree/master/dist/js/filefunnel-i18n.min.js) file. Unless otherwise specified, the browser locale will be used if the translation exists, otherwise **en_GB** is used as a fallback.\n\nTo manually enable individual locales, include the corresponding file located in [dist/js/filefunnel-i18n/](https://github.com/npolar/filefunnel.js/tree/master/dist/js/filefunnel-i18n).\n\n## Contribution:\nContributing to the project is encouraged, and any help is appreciated. Even if you are not familiar with JavaScript, you can still contribute to the project by adding translations, or stylesheet extensions for aesthetical improvements. If you experience any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, feel free to file an [issue](https://github.com/npolar/filefunnel.js/issues).\n\n#### Prerequisites:\nFirst, install [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node](https://nodejs.org)/[npm](https://npmjs.com) so you can download the required source files and dependencies. Afterwards, run the following commands to clone the repository, and automatically install the required developer dependencies:\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/npolar/filefunnel.js.git\ncd filefunnel.js && npm install\n```\n\n#### Language contributions:\nAfter cloning the project, you can add new translations to the [src/i18n](https://github.com/npolar/filefunnel.js/tree/master/src/i18n) directory, using one of the existing files in the same directory as a template. Please keep the same file name format as used by other translations. The JavaScript object containing all translations should be named using the full **language**_**TERRITORY** format (e.g. en_US). Abbreviations, if existent and standardised, can be added to the bottom of the file, such as:\n\n> FileFunnel.i18n.**en** = FileFunnel.i18n.**en_US**;\n\nAfter adding translation source files to the **src/i18n** directory, do **not** try to manually generate the distributed versions (i.e. files located in the **dist/** directory). These files are generated automatically by running the following command:\n\n```sh\ngulp\n```\n\n## Backend support:\nFileFunnel currently supports two methods of file uploading, namely *form-data* and *chunked* as descibed below.\nWhile *form-data* support is easier to implement on the backend, *chunked* allows for more flexibility.\nBoth of these utilise the **POST** method. Note that *progress tracking* will preflight the request with a **OPTIONS** header which has to be dealt with by the server for *chunked* uploads and *form-data* uploads with progress.\n\n#### Form-Data upload:\nThe simplest form of backend implementation is achieved by supporting the **multipart/form-data** *Content-Type* for non-chunked uploads.\nAll files are then uploaded in the same request body, with the file name specified as the form field name.\n\nThe following is a list of some limitations with this kind of upload:\n * No support for huge files, as the *total* acceptable size of *all files* is limited by the maximum supported body length\n * Inaccurate progress bars, as there is no way of telling how many bytes of each file has been uploaded\n * No support for status indicators on a per-file basis (i.e. individual success or failure indicators)\n * No standardised feedback on resulting location of successfully uploaded files (i.e. *Content-Location* headers)\n\n#### Chunked upload:\nAdding support for chunked uploads is a bit more complicated than for form-data uploads, but gives a more accurate progress bar on individual files, and allows for bigger file sizes.\nThe nature of chunked upload also allows for more accurate error messages if a file could not be successfully uploaded.\n\nIn order to accept chunked uploads, the following two headers must be accepted:\n * **X-File-Name** containing the file name of the current file being uploaded\n * **X-File-Size** containing the byte size of the current file being uploaded\n\nFile chunks are sent in the *correct order* so it should be easy to reassemble the files after all chunks has been received.\nBy using the custom **X-File-Size** header, the server can know that the complete file has been received when the *total* number of bytes of *all chunks* matches the value of the header.\nThe MIME type of the file being uploaded can be accessed by the **Content-Type** header, and the size of individual chunks is stored in the **Content-Length** header.\n\nFor more verbose output to the user, the following status codes *may* be used:\n\nCode    | Status message           | Description\n--------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n**201** | *Created*                | Indicates that the complete file has been received and saved\n**202** | *Accepted*               | Indicates that a chunk was successfully received\n**401** | *Unauthorized*           | Indicates that the user must be authenticated in order to upload\n**403** | *Forbidden*              | Indicates that the user does not have the sufficient rights to upload\n**409** | *Conflict*               | Indicates that the file already exists on the server (and duplicates are rejected)\n**412** | *Precondition Failed*    | Indicates that the header described in the *Vary* header is missing/erroneous\n**413** | *Payload Too Large*      | Indicates that the file is too big to be accepted\n**415** | *Unsupported Media Type* | Indicates that the file is of a media type not accepted by the server\n\nStatus code **412** is also used to indicate that the *filename* is *missing/erroneous*.\n\nAll status codes in the **2xx**-range are treated as **success**, while codes in the **4xx** and **5xx** -ranges are treated as **errors**.\nStatus codes in the **3xx**-range are currently not handled by the FileFunnel client.\n\nFor *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* (**CORS**) to work properly, the following headers must be set:\n\nHeader                               | Value\n-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------\n**Access-Control-Allow-Credentials** | **true** *(if requests with credentials are allowed)*\n**Access-Control-Allow-Headers**     | **Authorization, Content-Type, X-File-Name, X-File-Size**\n**Access-Control-Allow-Origin**      | *(comma-separated list of accepted origin URIs)*\n**Access-Control-Expose-Headers**    | **Content-Location**\n\nNote that for requests *without credentials*, the **Access-Control-Allow-Origin**-header can be set to **&#42;** (asterisk) in order to accept *any origin*. However, this is *NOT allowed* for requests *with credentials* (i.e. cookies and/or authentication).\n",
